04/07/2019::1.0::5.0::ECE310::Yes::No::N/A::She's not patient with students, sometimes she doesn't come prepared for lecture and wastes a lot of time doing problems. 
04/06/2019::1.0::1.0::ECE310::Yes::No::N/A::She is really INCONSISTENT with her grading. She has a really bad temper. Don't ever ask her questions because she will consider you as "questioning" her. Didn't find homework useful at all. There are no exam preps, not even practice problems, you just gotta know someone who took the class and pass you all the previous exams. 
03/04/2019::5.0::3.0::ECE310::Yes::Yes::B+::Simply put: professor Adla is amazing! She knows her stuff and willing to share her knowledge with students. It will take few weeks till you get to know her style of teaching but then it is smooth sailing. Good luck to you all! 
03/01/2019::5.0::2.0::ECE310::Yes::Yes::B::Thank you professor ADLA! You are the best! Thank you for explaining some subjects I had difficulty in understanding. You are awesome! University of Arizona should be proud to have you! Professor Adla was patient to go over some hard to understand marterials ovr and over. She made sure EVEYONE understand the course material. A+++ Teacher! Thanks 
03/01/2019::5.0::3.0::MATH101::Yes::Yes::A-::Prof. Adla was an excellent professor! She was clear and to the point! I feel that her effort was amazing in making us well prepared to class on all levels. 
02/28/2019::4.0::3.0::ECE310::Yes::Yes::A::I really enjoyed this class with prof. Adla. I liked the way she taught the 310 class by doing lots of in-class examples to help us grasp the material. I also liked that extra credit homework and the exam review session before each test. I worked hard throughout the semester but I got A. I wish she teaches more courses to take her again. 
01/24/2019::1.0::4.0::ECE310::No::No::A::The syllabus was unclear and constantly changed. New tests were added without much notice. 
01/24/2019::2.0::4.0::ECE310::No::No::B::She came to class unprepared and was not knowledgeable on the material. The grading was changed several times and was unclear. 
01/24/2019::2.0::4.0::ECE310::Yes::No::B::Class expectation changed in the middle of the semester (a 5% participation portion was added about 2 weeks before the final). Hw due dates were not clearly communicated. Tests were much harder than class. HW was unrelated to class examples. MatLab portion was not beneficial. Prof consistently made mistakes in class/grading, confusing us. 
01/24/2019::2.0::3.0::ECE310::Yes::No::B::Unclear grading criteria. She often made mistakes in class and ended up confusing students. Exam difficulty and her patience definitely changed as the semester went on. MATLAB section of class seemed pretty unhelpful. 
01/05/2019::5.0::3.0::ECE275::Yes::Yes::A::I learned a lot from Professor Adla. She was knowledgeable in the subject matter she was teaching ECE275. She was nice enough to give the whole class interesting assignments and had great understanding if someone missed an exam or needed extra help. She did great considering this was her first class at UA. Thank you 
12/23/2018::5.0::3.0::ECE275::Yes::Yes::N/A::Prof. Adla really cares about the students. Many projects and lots of work in this class but you can learn a lot. Easy to get A in her class if you put in work. Also, she offered 8% in extra credit project at the end of the semester. She is very accessible outside of class and would definitely recommend. 
12/12/2018::3.0::4.0::ECE275::Yes::Yes::N/A::Prof Adla is a brand new professor at the UA. This is how she runs her class; group collaboration, walks around and gives feedback, moves on to next topic. Rinse and repeat. Some may find it helpful, some may not. She is caring though, she let my friend who accidentally missed the final take it later on. And she has pushed back many due dates.
