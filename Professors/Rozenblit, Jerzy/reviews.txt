12/14/2016::5.0::2.0::HNRS195::No::Yes::A::One of the best profs youll have at college. Guaranteed. Dr. Rozenblit does not care so much about the grades he gives as he does about having a great academic experience. Graded very easily. Only requires one paper and one group led discussion. Take this class. 
12/09/2016::2.0::3.0::ECE175::Yes::No::A+::Lectures are important but, very repetitive and boring. Hard-ish material. Study for the midterms they are pretty challenging. Final project has a lot you can do to make up points lost. 
04/14/2016::3.5::1.0::HNRS117::No::Yes::A+::Had him for an honors colloqium, so there were no tests. Easy grader, very nice guy, encouraged discussions. 
12/14/2013::3.5::1.0::ECE479::No::N/A::A::Professor is extremely nice to students. Grades very loosely on exams and homework. Lecture is a bit random. His handwriting is pretty bad. This class is interesting, not hard at all, and class average is high. Worth taking if you want easy way out.
