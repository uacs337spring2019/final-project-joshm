12/14/2018::5.0::3.0::ECE351::Yes::Yes::N/A::Great Professor in the ECE department. He is one of those professors that if you fail his class it would totally because you didn't care. Gave us opportunities to get extra credit both in lab and exams, very approachable, finally learn what and how to use transistors and diodes and be great with PSPICE. Super glad that I took this class with him.
