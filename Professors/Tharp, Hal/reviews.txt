06/08/2017::5.0::4.0::ECE442::No::Yes::B::Tharp is a great professor. Probably one of my favorite out of all at the University of Arizona. Would HIGHLY recommend 
04/09/2017::5.0::4.0::ECE542::No::Yes::N/A::Great lecturer. He goes over the same concepts multiple times, which is frustrating if you already "get it" but know that he is trying to make sure the whole class follows. Watch out for his tests, there tend to be multiple "Curve Ball" questions. Do the practice exams, as they are based on previous classes and have the tricky questions. 
10/22/2015::5.0::3.0::ECE320::Yes::N/A::N/A::Good professor. EXAM is relatively hard. 
12/28/2013::4.5::3.0::ECE320A::No::N/A::A::Tharp is a very clear professor with an outrageous corny sense of humor. However, don't let his clear, simple teaching fool you: the tests will be hard. Fortunately, he posts practice tests and holds review sessions. 
08/08/2012::5.0::2.0::ECE340::Yes::N/A::N/A::He puts all class notes and lectures online, but because of his style of teaching, I still went to every lecture. His love and interest in the subject lends exceptionally well to conveying concepts simply and effectively. If you can get Tharp, do it 100% 
06/12/2012::4.5::3.0::ECE320::Yes::N/A::N/A::I can honestly say that he cares about the students more than any teacher I have had at the UofA. His tests can be a bit rough, but he curves and will even reteach topics if he notices the class struggling. His jokes are actually really entertaining which makes class entertaining! Class is not mandatory, but the quizzes WILL help your grade. 
01/13/2012::5.0::3.0::ECE207::Yes::N/A::N/A::One of the best professors at the UofA. He explains the material well and gives you tons of good study material for the tests. 
01/11/2012::5.0::1.0::ENGR102::No::N/A::N/A::Great class and very easy if you put the effort into it! He is a very understanding professor. 
01/07/2012::4.0::1.0::ENGR102::No::N/A::N/A::He's the adorably awkwardest teacher I have ever met. The course work was not difficult and although sometimes things did get boring, he did his best to spice things up. Honestly, I didn't like his "A can of soda. How many mountains can you climb?" Yeah, they're weird but understanding will help future as an engineer. 
05/11/2011::4.0::4.0::ECE207::Yes::N/A::N/A::He was a pretty good professor. Had some jokes thrown in there. Gave examples in class and was very helpful in office hours. All the exam problems were all or nothing, however. (multiple choice) 
04/05/2011::5.0::2.0::ECE340::Yes::N/A::N/A::Great, great, great professor. I don't know how he manages to make funny jokes out of stupid material, nor do I know how he makes interesting courses out of boring material, but I do know he's a fun guy. 
12/26/2010::5.0::3.0::ECE207::Yes::N/A::N/A::By far one of the best professors ive have at UA. He records his lectures and posts them online, so if you miss class, you dont fall behind. Also posts good study material online, and is very helpful in office hours. He cracks jokes all the time and definitely wants every student to succeed. 
12/21/2010::5.0::4.0::ECE207::Yes::N/A::N/A::Absolutely fantastic teachers, one of the best. 
12/19/2010::5.0::4.0::ECE207::Yes::N/A::N/A::Like previous comments, hes one of the best instructors. hes funny and goes over concepts clearly. he posts lecture notes, videos and previous exams for practice which are very helpful. i wish he taught other courses besides electrical engineering.
11/30/2010::5.0::3.0::ECE441::No::N/A::N/A::One of the best ECE professors at the UA. Take his classes. 
04/25/2008::5.0::4.0::ECE540::Yes::N/A::N/A::Best controls professor!
