05/16/2017::5.0::4.0::ECE320::Yes::Yes::B::Dr Dvorak is one of the best professors I have ever had, gives good examples in class and explains the physics behind it. Exams can be hard but gives a lot of partial credit if you are on the right track. 
12/09/2016::4.0::4.0::ECE381::Yes::Yes::N/A::Electromagnetics can be difficult, but Dvorak does a great job of focusing on the physical concepts underlying the equations he uses. He really does care, so please ask questions. For tests, practice derivations! More so than almost anything else. 
05/15/2016::5.0::4.0::ECE320::Yes::Yes::A::Awesome teacher. Two exams and a final. Tests are only 3-4 questions each, though he's decent about partial credit. Definitely wants his students to do well! I would recommend his class to anyone willing to put the time in to succeed. 
05/03/2015::4.0::4.0::ECE320::Yes::N/A::N/A::Prof. Dvorak is a great professor. Unfortunately, the material is pretty difficult, especially for non-ECE majors. All homework was done through MasteringEngineering, which was terrible. I would much rather do written homework, especially because the entire class is taught off the whiteboard with written examples. 
10/05/2011::5.0::4.0::ECE581A::Yes::N/A::N/A::Excellent presentation of advanced electromagnetic theory. Answered questions in class and out of class thoroughly. Take home midterms with interesting problems. Made difficult material approachable. Filled in gaps in text book. Very laid back and approachable professor. Take good notes in lecture, and do the homework.
