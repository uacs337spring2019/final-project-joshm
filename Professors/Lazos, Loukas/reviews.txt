12/22/2018::5.0::4.0::ECE175::Yes::Yes::A::Its a hard class in terms of work, however if you show up to class and do the work, you should do pretty well in the class. There are participation assignments every class, so show up to those. Lazos does a good job to introduce new concepts, some of which are difficult, and walks around class answering questions individually. 10/10 accent. 
12/18/2018::5.0::3.0::ECE175::No::Yes::A::Great professor. C programming is very difficult and the amount of material covered is difficult, but if you do the reading and stay ahead of the programming assignments, the class will seem easy. Overall very impressed with the zybooks reading the the interactivity of the lectures. Group project at the end usually ends with 1 person doing it. 
07/14/2017::4.0::2.0::ECE175::Yes::Yes::N/A::We worked in groups all through class doing examples. You have to pay attention to learn. They gave worksheets at the beginning of class everyday. And they were too focused on those that you couldn't do much else. I was told once not to take notes. The TAs are extremely helpful. All tests are open note. The lecture never correlated to the reading. 
04/14/2016::3.5::2.0::ECE175::Yes::N/A::A::A lot of people complain that this course is hard, but it really pays off if you move on to ECE 275 after. Class attendance and participation are instrumental to understanding the material. Took it as my first ever coding class and got an A. Put in the studying and time, and you'll do fine. 
02/25/2016::4.0::3.0::ECE175::Yes::Yes::B::Too good looking to be a professor... it was almost distracting 
01/10/2016::4.5::2.0::ECE175::No::Yes::A::The weekly coding assignments will require you to master the material, but the lab proctors are always available to help. Get to know them. Although the labs are 3 hours, you'll rarely spend more than an hour there. The reading is done in Z Y books, so is interactive. 
12/27/2015::3.0::4.0::ECE175::No::N/A::B+::The class is very challenging for those who have never programmed/coded before. Homework is given with multiple programs to create and is time-consuming--this class requires extra hours of studying. Although attendance is not mandatory, it is in your best interest to attend each lecture or you will be confused. No extra credit given for this course 
12/25/2015::2.5::4.0::ECE175::Yes::N/A::B::This class is super hard for people who have never taken programming or done any programming before. The first few weeks aren't bad though. When you go ask for help from his preceptors, the work is either done for you or they aren't clear about what you need to do. If you get help from him, he doesn't give you a clear answer either. 
01/08/2014::3.5::4.0::ECE175::Yes::N/A::B::If you want a real rating from a non-ece major, keep reading. Even though i got a B in this class, it was AWFUL. Each homework assignment takes DAYS and the labs are even worse. He makes this class SO much more difficult than it should be for an intro programming course. Lazos is helpful but the class is beyond hard. Avoid at all costs, fair warnin 
01/11/2013::4.0::1.0::ECE175::No::N/A::N/A::Great teacher. He's Greek so he has a slight accent, but nothing too bad; he's very clear and easy to understand. He answers any questions you have in class and he keeps lecture interesting and entertaining. He doesn't refer to the book much, more his notes, but you can find it all in the book if you need extra help. Loukas is a great professor! 
12/03/2012::5.0::2.0::ECE175::No::N/A::N/A::The professor is EXTREMELY helpful when you approach him for help with homework, tests, etc. I didn't have programming experience before this class. The class is very interesting. Learned a lot with Loukas. TA's were just OK.
