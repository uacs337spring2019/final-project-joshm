12/13/2018::5.0::4.0::ECE369::Yes::Yes::A::Akoglu is one of the best profs I've had. He cares about his students and understands that the material is hard so is always available to help. Tests are difficult but are open note, so if you study hard, do the practice tests, and take good notes, you'll be okay. The lab portion is hard, you can't wait to start the assignments or you won't finish
12/21/2015::4.5::4.0::ECE369::Yes::N/As::C::Prof. Akoglu was a very passionate professor. I have taken him for 274 and for 369 and while the classes were not easy, he was willing to work with me to get me to where I needed to be. He wants his students to pass and do well and is willing to extend deadlines to do so. Be prepared to spend a lot of extra time in the lab working on the project. 
11/30/2015::4.5::4.0::ECE369::Yes::No::N/A::Awesome professor. Knows what he is talking about and is very passionate about it. He understands how hard the students work and adjusts the due dates/ material accordingly. Apply yourself and do the readings, stay up do date with the project and Akoglu will be there to help you every step of the way. Yes, this class is HARD but extremely rewarding 
08/28/2015::4.0::4.0::ECE274::Yes::No::A::Best Teacher and learn VHDL as soon as possible. 
03/06/2015::2.5::5.0::ECE274::No::N/A::N/A::Nice guy, but not very vocal. He's much more helpful in his office hours than in class. The class wasn't hard so much as the way to class was conducted needs serious work. No homework means no practice or preparation for tough exams. There is virtually no instruction on learning verilog, you have to figure it out yourself. 
12/23/2014::4.0::4.0::ECE274A::Yes::N/A::N/A::He has a real passion for the material and wants everyone else to share it too. The lectures are usually understandable, but the tests will try to get you to go the extra mile in applying the material. No matter how bad your grade seems like it's going to be while in the class, though, as long as you legitimately try, he's got your back. 
10/15/2014::4.0::4.0::ECE369::Yes::N/A::N/A::It was very interesting class for me. The major part is group project. You need to clearly understand pipelining, registers, timing, etc. Paying real close attention to his lectures will help a lot. And choose teammate with care, its 2 person project.
