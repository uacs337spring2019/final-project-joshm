01/02/2019::3.0::3.0::ECE207::Yes::Yes::A::Not a bad professor. Lectures mostly explained what would be on the HW but HW was very annoying when they didn't. HW is through Mastering but there is Extra Credit on every assignment. Quizzes are announced in class so make sure you show up. The quizzes helped a lot to understand the material. Tests had very few curve balls. Overall a decent class. 
12/26/2018::1.0::3.0::ECE373::No::No::B::Avoid like the plague. If you're an ECE student take the equivalent course in the CS department for credit - trust me. But get into that ASAP because it's always filled to max because people try to dodge this class with this professor. Dr. Marefat is just checked out. Read the other comments below, they are true. It's a painful class. Avoid. 
12/13/2018::1.0::3.0::ECE373::No::No::A::Lectures were not engaging/interesting. Expectations were very unclear. Assignment requirements would be posted the night before (or night of) large projects being due. The midterm was too long and completely unfair. The final was difficult though fair. However, only half the class got to start the final on time because of a 'printer malfunction'. 
01/04/2018::1.0::4.0::ECE373::No::No::B::Relatively easy class until the final that bombs you on purpose and you will most likely drop a letter grade if you are not prepared. The class is useless but the class attendant is required. He doesn't care with whatever grade you get so don't even bother to talk to him about your grade if you are getting a 79 or 89. 
12/20/2017::1.0::4.0::ECE207::No::No::N/A::Dr. Marefat was not only unclear with much of the material, but he spent more time gathering his notes and playing useless videos than actually teaching. I would not recommend any of his classes. 
12/20/2016::5.0::3.0::ECE207::No::Yes::A::Dr. Marefat really went out of his way to make sure we did well in this class by posting lectures online, holding plenty of office hours, and offering extra credit opportunities. Exams are okay if you study the homework and lectures. Attendance is somewhat mandatory due to in-class problems. Overall good guy and would recommend! 
11/01/2016::1.0::3.0::ECE373::No::No::N/A::Absolutely terrible. Gives pop quizzes frequently that are worth a ton of your grade, but sometimes he doesn't even go to his own lectures. Gave a midterm exam that was absurdly long, and not a single person finished. As "extra credit" he assigned the ridiculous problem as a take home project, and averaged our grades with the project score. Avoid. 
12/25/2015::3.0::3.0::ECE207::Yes::N/A::B::He mostly uses examples in class so the best way to do well is to read the book & get homework help in office hours. He also does class activities that count as participation credit but there is no way to know when he does this so you need to be in class. Most students had a lot of tests at the same time as test 2 & he gave 2 extra credits. 
05/21/2015::3.0::4.0::ECE207::Yes::N/A::A::Dr. Marefat has a very kind personality. I felt he actually did want us to pass. This was, of course, a difficult class, but pay attention in lectures because the examples he does are very useful to study for the tests. It is possible to get an A, just study hard and pay attention. He told a few jokes and had some interesting trivia. 
05/19/2015::1.5::4.0::ECE466::No::N/A::N/A::Marefat has no care fore his classes and puts very little time into them. I've taken two classes with him, and they were both the same. He starts class 5-15 minutes late every day and tries to keep you after. The lectures are never useful and he speaks very softly. He waits to grade all testsassignments until at least 1 week after finals. 
04/24/2015::3.0::4.0::ECE207::Yes::N/A::A-::First, allow me to say that this is not an easy course, regardless of the professor. Second, it was his first time teaching ECE 207. He sometimes had some trouble explaining the material and in some instances was a little unclear. However, if you read the book and the notes, you should understand it. He gives a lot of partial credit though. 
04/28/2014::2.0::2.0::ECE373::No::N/A::N/A::Lectures are boring. At least he asks what was on his lecture slides.so just read them for exam. As for the project, if u are not good with programming, better avoid this course. U won't learn much and just stress over the project. 
01/14/2014::1.0::2.0::ECE373::No::N/A::B-::Often late, rambling quiet lecturer. ECE373 focuses on minutiae of Java specific object orientation rather than practical programming. You have an opportunity to write cool Java code, but you'll have to teach yourself how to do it, because you won't learn anything except very basic OO concepts from the lecture. 
11/15/2012::2.5::2.0::ECE373::No::N/A::N/A::If you've never programmed before, I wouldn't take a class with this professor. He rambles about hardly anything during lectures, is late to class, and on one test, he switched his mind on a problem with 30 minutes to go. He is unorganized, and it's very hard to learn. If you do take his class, study the text since he doesn't teach much in class. 
07/06/2011::1.5::3.0::ECE175::Yes::N/A::N/A::If you have any grasp on programming the first 3/4's of the class is easy, but after that when you reach pointers the class is extremely difficult due to his poor teaching. He is very quiet, his code usually has at least one error in it and expects you to translate that over to the tests he makes you take. 
07/02/2011::1.0::4.0::ECE175::No::N/A::N/A::This class was horrible!! I expected to learn C language yet I left the class more confused than when I entered. The tests had nothing to do with the class and the notes were impossible to read. Expect to spend 20+ hours on one assignment! STAY AWAY!
