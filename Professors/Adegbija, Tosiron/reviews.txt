11/05/2018::4.0::3.0::ECE274::No::Yes::A::Took both 275 and 474a with Tosi, He is awesome! It won't be the easiest class, but if you turn everything in and put in a basic amount of effort i dont see any way you get below a C. Tests are not super easy but they aren't messed up hard either. He does not curve but gives lots of chances to work for extra credit. Top 5 professor in ECE at UofA 
11/29/2017::5.0::3.0::ECE474::No::Yes::A::Best professor I have ever had in college. 
04/19/2016::4.5::2.0::ECE462::No::Yes::A+::Sometimes lectures are a bit confusing but if you speak up he will stop the lecture until you understand the topic. Additionally he is extremely friendly and is very easy to talk to. I recommend anyone take courses with him
