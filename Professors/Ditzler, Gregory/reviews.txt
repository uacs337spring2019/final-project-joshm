05/02/2018::5.0::3.0::ECE523::No::Yes::A::Best professor I have ever had. Ditzler knows his stuff and how to communicate difficult topics well. Take his class if you get the chance. 
12/18/2017::4.0::2.0::ECE441A::No::Yes::N/A::Pretty easy course, and Dr. Ditzler for the most part was a good teacher. Efficient, effective, and clear expectations. Every once in a while, he explained things in an unnecessarily weird way, but this didn't happen often, and it was usually simple to remedy either in office hours or a different perspective. 
4/20/2012::4.5::2.0::ECE220::Yes::Yes::B::A great professor
