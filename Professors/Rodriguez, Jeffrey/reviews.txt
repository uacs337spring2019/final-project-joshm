11/22/2017::4.0::3.0::ECE529::No::Yes::A::Good Lecturer for DSP (ECE529). Felt that I really learned the material. Moderate courseload. Exam difficulty varied throughout semester (one super easy, one hard, and one medium). Grading was fair, there was a decent curve. Had issues with communication (he doesn't always respond to email) which is painful for an online course. 
12/09/2016::2.0::3.0::ECE320A::Yes::No::N/A::Dr. Rodriguez frankly doesn't seem to care about his students. His lectures are dull and often uninformative, and his tests are highly gimmicky (computation heavy, multiple choice designed to trick rather than assess). Not the worst, but avoid if possible. 
01/15/2016::4.0::4.0::ECE533::No::N/A::A::He knows his stuff well and covers a lot of topics in each class. If you don't understand concepts try going to the office hours, as he explains with much more examples to make concepts clear. Exams are tough and lengthy and cover a lot of topics so prepare well. His notes are good enough to do the exams well. 
07/03/2015::4.5::3.0::ECE429::Yes::N/A::N/A::He covers the material very fast and knows his stuff well. Exams are difficult and you don't stand a chance of getting partial credit. 
05/18/2015::3.0::5.0::ECE529::Yes::N/A::C+::This is for the Online section: There was very little to no communication for the online students. There were issues with the online videos that caused the online students to be a month behind. The criteria for grading on homework and project isn't always clear. Grades aren't posted normally (via d2l) and the online tools are lacking. 
02/06/2015::4.5::3.0::ECE429::Yes::N/A::N/A::Great lecturer. Makes complicated topics easy to understand. Tests were fair. 
05/15/2012::5.0::3.0::ECE532::No::N/A::N/A::Notes were very helpful. He knows his stuff very well and teaches from the basics. Programming assignments were very helpful in understanding the material well. He also gives hints about programming in the class which helps you complete them easily. Exams are standard and make you think. 
04/05/2011::4.0::5.0::ECE320::Yes::N/A::N/A::A lot of my fellow classmates didn't like him, but he's a good lecturer, he really knows his stuff, and he's usually pretty polite. His low popularity is due to his exams. The best way to deal with them is by not getting intimidated. Overall, he's a solid professor, especially considering he's here mostly for research. 
01/15/2011::5.0::5.0::ECE320A::No::N/A::N/A::His lecture is helpful but he speaks a little too fast. You have to pay attention to follow him, or you will get lost. The exams are pretty hard and totally different from the homework. You need to be familar with all the material for each chapter. There is no partial credit in the exam . 
12/07/2010::3.5::4.0::ECE320A::Yes::N/A::N/A::He's not a bad lecturer, but the tests are brutal unless you're a good M/C guesser. He curves pretty generously though (D is an A). 
05/13/2010::4.0::4.0::ECE528::Yes::N/A::N/A::He explains abstract math formulas in an intuitive understandable way. Cool. 
01/19/2006::4.0::4.0::ECE531::N/A::N/A::N/A::Well, he's good.
