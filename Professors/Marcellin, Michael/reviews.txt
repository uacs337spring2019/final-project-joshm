05/11/2018::5.0::4.0::ECE220::No::Yes::A::best professor that I have had at UA. very interesting and relevant information, presented clearly and logically. gives lots of examples and tons of practice for the exams, as well as extra credit opportunities. make sure you attend class or you will get behind, as he covers a lot of information each class! 
05/01/2018::5.0::3.0::ECE220::No::Yes::N/A::He's one of the best professors! He has a lot of fun stories and he is really chill! You will learn a lot from the class! He gives out extra credit sometimes, so don't miss classes. 
04/05/2018::5.0::2.0::ECE220::Yes::Yes::A::One of the best professors I have had. His lectures are great, He is willing to help you if you don't understand, he enjoys teaching and doesn't give excessive online homework. He makes the class easy and gives lots of chances by curving the class dropping a test and giving extra credit. Even though he makes the class easy you will learn a lot. 
01/03/2018::5.0::4.0::ECE220::Yes::Yes::B::Best professor I've had, super willing to give help outside of class, amazing. 
12/29/2017::5.0::4.0::ECE220::No::Yes::B+::Dr. Marcellin is one of the best professors I've ever had at the University of Arizona. I highly encourage anyone who is in SIE or outside of ECE to take him because ECE 220 can be taken instead of some other courses that might not have as great of a professor. It may be 5 credit course but it is 100% worth it as long as you're committed to learning 
11/22/2017::4.0::4.0::ECE503::No::Yes::N/A::ECE503. There was a lot of material and topics to cover for just one semester. It seemed a little rushed. The class is pure mathematics with very little context for engineering applications. You will probably spend more time on this class than any other upper level course. Homework was long/tedious. Tests were not bad. Grading was generous. 
08/18/2017::5.0::2.0::ECE220::Yes::Yes::A+::Easily the best professor I've had here. He legitimately wants all his students to get As and gives ample resources to help them get there. His lectures are engaging, he has great humorous stories, and he holds extra optional lectures to help students review for his exams. A+ 
05/15/2017::5.0::2.0::ECE220::No::Yes::A+::Best Professor Ever! 
12/16/2016::5.0::2.0::ECE220::Yes::Yes::A::He is the best professor I've ever had. He cares very much about the success of his students. His lectures are fantastic, and every one was worth it. ECE 220 is a lot of work, but Professor Marcellin made a subject that I previously found difficult into something very manageable. 
06/04/2016::5.0::3.0::ECE220::Yes::Yes::A::Dr. Marcellin's ECE220 is easily the best ECE class I've taken. The guy cares about his students' success, and genuinely wants everyone to do well. The midterm exams are tricky but fair. The final exam is excruciating, but you can expect a class-wide grade boost afterwards. Quizzes are given at random, so go to class! 85% gets you an A. 
04/18/2016::5.0::3.0::ECE220::No::N/A::N/A::Basic Circuits is naturally very dry and dull in my opinion, but Marcellin is a fantastic, enjoyable teacher. You'll come to love story time, and his explanations are clear and precise. It's an easy course if you get the fundamentals and practice. He posts lots of old tests--USE THEM! They're basically the same. 
01/10/2016::5.0::4.0::ECE220::Yes::N/A::A::Incredible professor!His tests are very comprehensive and you need to attend all review sessions and complete all of the practice exams. Watch out for his lab requirement, since missing a single lab report can easily cost you 20% of your final course grade. If you do the work, you should get an A, however! 
10/20/2015::5.0::3.0::ECE220::No::Yes::N/A::Great teacher. USE THE PRACTICE EXAMS!!! He never uses e as a test answer, except for extra credit questions. Great teacher and class. I wish he was my teacher for every class. 
05/12/2018::4.5::2.5::ECE220::Yes::Yes::A::Makes the topic of circuits approachable, is entertaining, and offers plenty of room to succeed
