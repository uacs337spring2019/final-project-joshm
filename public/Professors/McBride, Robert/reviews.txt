04/02/2019::3.0::4.0::ECE207::Yes::No::N/A::Homework assignments counted for points, and there were a huge number of them. Tests were straight-forward if you went to class, since all he did was work through problem sets. That's the thing; he was great at explaining how to solve the problems but terrible at explaining concepts. Read the book and go to class, you'll be fine. 
12/13/2018::5.0::3.0::ECE175::Yes::Yes::A::Mcbride by far has been one of my favorite teachers. In this class Zybooks is extremely helpful (the online textbook) and with Mcbride it was a great class. If you dont understand something early on just make sure you ask him or one of the TAs everything builds off each other. This was my first time coding and it was great ! 
05/28/2018::2.0::4.0::ECE175::Yes::No::A::McBride is not the best instructor for ECE courses because he is not the best person at explaining difficult ideas to students who are new to programming. 
05/03/2018::5.0::4.0::ECE175::Yes::Yes::A::McBride was a great professor for 175. He has a day job using C so he knows what hes talking about. Sometimes his lecture can be unhinged, but you always learn what you need to. Absolutely a wonderful professor. 
08/18/2016::3.0::4.0::ECE207::Yes::No::B::Lectures are not well organized but the syllabus is. It helps to outline the topics to be discussed before class. This is where the book comes in handy. Otherwise he will typically start drawing circuits and one becomes lost. Also, he writes his own homework problems, however, most are very similar to examples in the book which is great! 
12/10/2016::4.0::5.0::ECE175::Yes::Yes::A::Robert really cares about his students. Go to his office hours or email him because he is very helpful. You may not feel the lectures are worth while but he gives out occasional extra credit and answers to tests and homework if you attend lectures regularly. Overall, this class is the hardest class I've taken so far but Robert tries to help a lot. 
5/16/2016::5.0::3.0::ECE207::Yes::Yes::A::Prof. McBride is probably the best professor I've ever had. His lectures are excellent, involving both clear explanations and copious examples. Attendance isn't necessary but absolutely encouraged. Makes a lot of time for his students for office hours. Difficult tests, but very doable if you've done the hw. Wish I could take him again. 
01/13/2016::4.5::2.0::ECE175::No::Yes::A::This professor is one of the best I had. He was very helpful, entertaining, and friendly. Assignments were often tough, but grading was fair. I would highly recommend him for ECE 175. 
11/02/2015::4.0::2.0::ECE175::Yes::N/A::A+::This class is very tough unless you read the book. It is hard to teach programming in a lecture so you must learn from the homework and the book. Mcbride was a great guy though and always helped as he wanted his students to do well. Lots of extra credit opportunities during the final project.

01/14/2015::4.5::3.0::ECE207::Yes::Yes::N/A::He was the best professor I've ever had. Lectures were always entertaining. He managed to also negotiate with the whole class on grading criteria and other issues and was always very fair about it. He wants you to do well and was always willing to help. Exams were long and tough, but fair. Mainly had similar or tricky HW problems. Huge curve. 
01/03/2015::4.5::4.0::ECE207::Yes::N/A::A-::The material was pretty hard but Mcbride explained it really well and never treated me stupid even though the questions I asked seemed so. 
01/02/2015::5.0::4.0::ECE207::Yes::N/A::N/A::The best professor I have had at U of A. He answers questions in lecture clearly and better than any professor I have had previously. He taught every lecture from an elmo projector and held reviews before every test. Tests are no cakewalk but study hard and you'll do fine. Go to office hours! He offers lots of extra help there.
