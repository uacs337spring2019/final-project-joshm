06/06/2014::5.0::4.0::ECE351A::Yes::N/A::B::Wonderful professor! He expects a lot of students but as a result students learn much more than a typical class. You will be expected to come to class prepared and to do your assignments thoroughly but as a reward you will receive some of the best scientific training available. 
01/13/2010::4.5::4.0::ECE351A::Yes::N/A::N/A::Good teacher, hammers the concepts in until they're solid. There are like 3 tests and a final. The 3 tests are medium hard, but you better know your stuff for the final...the final is 50% of the grade and it is a challenging test. Just go to study sessions and hw reviews and you'll be good. Also attend class... 
05/26/2009::3.5::4.0::ECE500::No::N/A::N/A::Not very clear at times, but helpful despite my not understanding the material well. 
05/13/2009::5.0::5.0::ECE304::No::N/A::N/A::Dr. Higgins Rocks! These other people have no idea what theyre talking about, they just aren't good at engineering in general. This isn't a class you can memorize, and if you don't understand the material youre going crash and burn. Higgins is smart, funny, and will explain things in review sessions and office hrs with ease. Good prof, bad students 
05/13/2005::1.0::5.0::ECE304::No::N/A::N/A::grading was not fair. 
12/26/2008::1.0::5.0::ECE450::No::N/A::N/A::Dr. Higgins class was completely useless, not to mention biased grading and hostile comments.
