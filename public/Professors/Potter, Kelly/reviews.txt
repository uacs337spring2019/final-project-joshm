04/10/2018::5.0::4.0::ECE352::Yes::Yes::C::One of the more difficult classes I have taken in terms of material, but one of the most rewarding. She is an amazing teacher, very good at answering questions, has high expectations, but is also very fair and understanding. If she explained something confusingly, in the rare event that she does, she will quickly correct it. Do all the homework. 
12/09/2017::4.0::3.0::ECE352::No::Yes::A::Dr. Potter actually cares about students learning the material and will even schedule her lectures in order to go over things that students struggle to understand. She wants everyone to do well so she assigns a few extra credit assignments. She will never trick you on an exam. All you need is to study the notes and lectures and you should do well 
01/16/2015::2.0::3.0::ECE434::No::N/A::N/A::If you're an ECE or physics major stay away. MSE and optics majors love her but for ECE and physics majors this class will be boring and mundane. She uses power points and skips all the mathphysics and goes straight to wordy explanations and graphs that you couldve taught yourself from wikipedia. Wont learn any of the physics just wikifacts 
12/28/2013::4.0::4.0::ECE434::Yes::N/A::N/A::Professor Potter is very fun and nice, but the class is advanced stuff and her homework grading is strict. You will learn a lot, and half of it isn't even in the textbook. I can't tell whether it's the material or the professor, but sometimes it's hard to grasp the ideas in this class. She requires you to understand the hows and whys thoroughly. 
11/10/2007::5.0::1.0::ENGR102::No::N/A::N/A::I don't know about other classes but having Potter for ENGR102 is a big reason why I am an engineering major. This class is fun and interesting but attendance is mandatory 2/3 days a week. This class is 90% team work; you don't get to pick teams so I could see how this class sucks if you get a bad team. My team was great 
12/09/2006::2.0::5.0::ECE459::Yes::N/A::N/A::She is the teacher with the worst teaching skills I have ever seen in my life. She speaks too fast and tries to teach too much (the whole more-than-600-pages book in one semester). Stay away if you can. 
11/27/2005::2.5::4.0::ENGR102::N/A::N/A::N/A::She grades really tough on reports. Team-work is everything in this class. I ended up doing everything for my****y team: reports, most of the projects and research.
