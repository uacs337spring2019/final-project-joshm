12/24/2014::2.0::4.0::ECE486::Yes::N/A::N/A::Not good but not the worst. The class is not easy but not harder than Electromagnetics, especially since Dr. Xin can explain things well. The course is also fun with a chance to build RF circuits. Unfortunately, he doesn't seem to care and doesn't post things online, takes forever to grade, and the horrible TA teaches half the lectures. 
02/04/2013::1.5::5.0::ECE381A::No::N/A::N/A::I have to say it is a big mistake to take this professor's class. One thing I feel bad is he sometimes doesn't know the lecture material surfficiently well. But he kind of pretends to know every point and answers student's questions perfunctorily. It should be a nice class to take if taught by a more responsible professor. 
11/05/2012::1.5::5.0::ECE381A::No::N/A::N/A::This course is very difficult for juniors or even seniors. He usually cannot make his point clear enough to students. In addition, he just uses class notes of another teacher. I don't think he has spent enough time to understand the notes and prepare the classes. Maybe this course is a good choice for graduate students. 
10/26/2012::3.0::4.0::ECE381::No::N/A::N/A::He is a Chinese but makes the lectures easy to understand. However, I don't think he is good since all his lecture notes and exams are copied from another professor. It sometimes makes some problems. For the exams, the first exam is pretty easy, the average will be about 80. All others will be pretty hard(50 in average).
