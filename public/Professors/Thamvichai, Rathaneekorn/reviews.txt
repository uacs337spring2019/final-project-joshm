01/11/2018::4.0::4.0::ECE175::Yes::Yes::A+::Pretty decent lecturer, occasionally cracks jokes. Overall a fairly difficult course, but I thought the homework programs were designed really well. They highlight whatever you were just taught in the course, and were all appropriately challenging. Start them early. 
05/09/2017::5.0::4.0::ECE175::Yes::Yes::B::ECE 175 is a tough class but Dr. Kay makes it bearable. Lectures consist mostly of group activities which are somewhat similar to the homework assignments. She is a very entertaining lecturer and very committed to her students-she even stays long after class has ended to help with homework. Definitely recommend her for this class! 
05/09/2017::5.0::3.0::ECE274::Yes::Yes::A::She is a fantastic teacher; she knows what she is talking about it and explains the class in a straight forward and simple way. She is quick to recognize your mistakes and explain to you what you did wrong. Go to office hours the moment you fall behind. 
01/12/2017::5.0::3.0::ECE274::Yes::Yes::A::One of the best instructors i had. Took her for two ECE classes 175, 274, and has never regretted taking her. SHOW UP TO CLASS, she is a good lecturer, and live in her office hours if you can. she will try to explain everything and all questions you have. Def. recommend taking. 
01/07/2016::4.0::3.0::ECE274::Yes::N/A::N/A::One of my favorite ECE professors. In 274, there were a lot of pop quizzes, but if you showed up, they were fairly easy. Lecture is mostly doing examples, including some coding, and she's very helpful if you have a lab or test question. 
12/17/2015::5.0::5.0::ECE274::No::N/A::A::Dr. Kay is a great teacher, but digital logic is a tricky subject. The lab is very tedious, and even though Dr. Kay does her best to help, it's a pain. There are also tons of pop quizzes and exams, and the material--while not super hard--moves very fast. 274 is fun, but if you need to take it, take it with her. She really cares about her students. 
12/02/2015::4.5::1.0::ECE175::Yes::Yes::A+::Took Dr. Kay's class for both ECE 175 and ECE 274a. She knows what she is talking about and always showed up to labs when she didn't have to be. She is really helpful in office hours/ labs. Her tests are fair even though there are a lot (in 274a). If you do the work and pay attention in class, it is very easy to get an A, esp. with extra credit. 
05/19/2015::5.0::3.0::ECE175::Yes::N/A::N/A::Dr. Kay is fantastic and funny. There are program homeworks every week, two exams(23% each), and and final project instead of a final(23%). Her tests are totally fair and the final project was actually kind of fun. The final project she offered enough extra credit to make up 5% of the total in class grade. 
04/17/2015::4.5::3.0::ECE175::Yes::N/A::N/A::Dr. Kay is definitely a solid teacher. I did have a lot of interest in this class, so it was pretty easy for her to inspire me to do my best. Some portions are tough, especially at the end of the semester. There is a TON of homework and reading, but she does go over all of the reading in class in a better way than the book, so got to class. 
12/19/2014::5.0::3.0::ECE175::Yes::N/A::A::Dr. Kay is great! As someone who has never coded before, I can say that I've learned a lot. The class can be difficult if you don't get coding but her office hours and the TA office hours are a great help! She is super helpful and funny. Lecture can be a bit boring but she really tries to make class interesting. 
11/18/2014::4.5::2.0::ECE175::Yes::Yes::N/A::Professor Kay made me love programming more than I ever thought was possible. At the beginning of the semester I thought this would be my least favorite class but it ended up being the one I looked forward to every week. Professor Kay makes lectures fun and interesting. Definitely one of my all time favorite professorsclasses! 
10/23/2014::4.5::2.0::ECE175::Yes::N/A::A::Prof. Kay (No idea about her names, good nick name though) is the best! I learned so much from her, I could not even begin to express it. Witty, smart and attentive, she made special exceptions for my conflicting schedule needs and checked in to make sure everything was working out during the semester. One of the great profs I have ever had! 
04/11/2014::5.0::1.0::ECE322::No::N/A::A+::I took her at St. Cloud State in MN, and miss her dearly. Best professor in the dept. She probably isn’t settled in where she is now, but she is incredibly helpful, and when she has taught the course for a while, she gets to be the perfect teacher. The tests were perfect. Received over 100% in class, gave all necessary information. Perfect teacher. 
03/27/2014::4.5::3.0::ECE340::Yes::N/A::N/A::A very good and helpful teacher. You should not miss her.
04/22/2019::4.0::4.0::ECE274::Yes::Yes::A::Really just so rare
04/20/2019::5.0::4.0::ECE175::Yes::Yes::B::Aha Aha Aha
07/06/2016::5.0::4.5::ECE275::Yes::Yes::B-::Woah such a good teacher
