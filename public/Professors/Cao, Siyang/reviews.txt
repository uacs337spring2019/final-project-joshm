01/11/2019::5.0::2.0::ECE538::No::Yes::A::Very organized. Not a lot of HW (but they are relatively long). Exams are easy and he is a very easy grader. Projects are fun to do. He focuses on the simulation results rather than the report itself (no specific format is required). Extremely helpful during office hours. The course materials are a little bit challenging but enjoyable. 
04/10/2018::4.0::2.0::ECE310::Yes::Yes::A::He is still a new teacher at the time I wrote this, but actively improving. He is very considerate. When he wrote a rather aggressive exam, he curved accordingly, but he typically doesn't make hard exams. And the exams have extra points so you can recover your points if you know you missed a problem. Best professor to take this course with.
