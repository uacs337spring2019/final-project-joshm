11/20/2018::4.0::3.0::ECE513::Yes::Yes::B+::Dr. Lysecky is an excellent lecturer. He assigns more reading than is normal in an engineering class, but it's all immediately used in the next class. The course project is a lot of work, but it uses the majority of what was covered in class, and is involved enough to be interesting. He does track class participation every lecture though. 
10/29/2015::5.0::2.0::ECE574::Yes::N/A::A+::His class are really interested but he is losing his interest slowly. Does not care anymore. He is waging a losing battle with the department. But his class is a must for any undergrad/ grad student. His TA's have more knowledge than a lot of TA's in the department. Overall make sure you work hard. 
05/18/2015::5.0::3.0::ECE274::No::Yes::N/A::He's the man. Take him. Get his classes. 
01/14/2014::4.0::4.0::ECE275::No::N/A::A::Roman is a real great guy, but not always the best lecturer. He puts up tiny written code on a projector that you're supposed to follow along with. It's a lot of information given quickly, and the code assignments are quite difficult. If you go to office hours, you'll find him more than willing to give you the help you need. 
12/17/2012::4.5::3.0::ECE275::Yes::N/A::N/A::I would definitely recommend him as a teacher. He really knows his stuff and is always willing to help students through the material, both through email and in office hours. 
12/12/2012::5.0::3.0::ECE274::Yes::N/A::N/A::Great guy and professor, he is always helpful and wants his students to succeed. I had two classes with him the semester and enjoyed them both thoroughly. 
08/31/2011::5.0::5.0::ECE274::Yes::N/A::N/A::Really cool Professor 
02/15/2011::4.0::1.0::ECE577::No::N/A::N/A::Really cool and passionate. 
12/14/2009::4.5::2.0::ECE274::Yes::N/A::N/A::Overall pretty good prof, can be a bit boring sometimes. Tests are tricky (near impossible to get an A), and you have to religiously study the book. Homeworks are a couple hours worth a week. Labs are ultra-easy to finish early (and not show up the next week). He drops lowest scores on tests+hw, so getting an A is possible but not guaranteed. 
12/12/2009::5.0::3.0::ECE274::Yes::N/A::N/A::Great professor who is passionate about the material. Lectures very well and is clear about the material. Textbook is well-written also. Exams are frequent (one every three weeks), so be prepared to study consistently. Grading is very fair, although the design problems on the exams are generally rather tricky. Overall, great class.
