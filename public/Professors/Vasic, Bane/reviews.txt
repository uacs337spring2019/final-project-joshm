04/14/2019::2.0::5.0::ECE435::Yes::No::N/A::The material is interesting and it's clear that Dr. Vasic knows his stuff. But the only things that are graded are the tests and projects. The projects are made to be difficult and the tests are all theory based so be ready to be know the derivations front and back. Also difficult considering ECE is notorious for having terrible ECE340 instructors. 
04/19/2016::1.5::5.0::ECE435::No::N/A::N/A::I can honestly say he is the worst instructor I've taken at the U of A. His course is exceedingly difficult (especially for undergrads). He expects you to know advanced theories that he drops casually in class and calls them "simple derivations." He assigns homework and quizzes with no forewarning or schedule. Would not recommend. Avoid. 
04/19/2016::1.0::5.0::ECE435::Yes::N/A::N/A::Most likely the worst professor I've ever had at Arizona. His plethora of mathematical mistakes while doing derivations then tells students to look it up in his notes which are unreadable in his handwriting. He then makes students feel stupid when they ask questions questioning them as to how they do not understand the material. Stay away from him. 
10/28/2010::2.0::4.0::ECE503::No::N/A::N/A::Almost 90% of master and PhD degrees at his department are awarded to nationals from India and China. If you are American or Native American forget about the graduate studies at this department. 
11/12/2009::4.0::2.0::ECE503::Yes::N/A::N/A::Very cool guy. Mathematically sound and those who like Maths would like his teaching too. 
05/09/2008::2.0::5.0::ECE340::No::N/A::N/A::He Tries to make you feel stupid. Puts hard problems on test that he can do in 3 lines and makes you feel stupid if you cant. 
05/17/2007::2.0::5.0::ECE340::No::N/A::N/A::This guy makes the class unreasonably hard. The book sucks, and the online lecture notes are useless, unless you can read scribble. He was a nice guy but made the class way too hard. Take it with someone else if possible. 
12/06/2006::4.0::5.0::ECE340::Yes::N/A::N/A::Book was fairly difficult to understand, online notes (which are argueably better then any DSP text I've read) were the only way to make it through the course. Still, he basically explains what is going to be on each test, so its not impossible to do well. 
07/29/2006::2.5::4.0::ECE340::N/A::N/A::N/A::He acts like a hard ass and tries to intimidate you until after the drop day. Still, the book is horrible, his notes are unreadable usually, and if you don't know MatCAD, you are generally screwed. Most of the learning you do will be from your peers or other sources. There is a curve, dispite what he says, but the class is still hard. 
04/21/2006::1.0::4.0::ECE340::N/A::N/A::N/A::If at all possible choose another professor to take it with.
