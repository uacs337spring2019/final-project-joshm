05/21/2015::3.5::4.0::ECE330::No::N/A::A::Plays piano during class. Ask around for previous years' tests. They will make the test much less stressful because you get a better idea of what kind of questions he will ask. I've never personally been to his office hours, but his TA's were were very helpful and available. No textbook necessary. 
05/20/2015::4.5::4.0::ECE330::No::N/A::N/A::A great teacher but with a couple of minor flaws. If you take good notes, your notebook will be an excellent study guide. He is happy to help you if you see him in his office. It is obvious he wants his students to pass. However, he would always show up to class 5 to 10 minutes late. He cancelled office hours a few times. Textbook was useless. 
05/10/2015::3.0::4.0::ECE330::No::N/A::A-::8 HW assignments that involved writing code for Matlab. Not very hard, even though I had no prior experience with Matlab before this class. Tests are the hardest part of this class. 2 midterms, and they each cover a lot of the material that you learn in class and involve lots of derivations. He also takes attendance...
